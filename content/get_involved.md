## How to get involved

1. Sign up to the MAPS mailing list [here](https://bristolexppsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6xLmGYOV2rh2JyR)
2. You will receive instruction on how to register for the project via this mailing list. 
3. The data will be distributed via the mailing list. 

Note: 

* All project communication from us to you will be through the mailing list. 
* If you would like to ask us a question please email maps-project [at] bristol dot ac dot uk (see the link in the top right hand corner). 

## Important information

All the information can be found on our OSF materials page [here](https://osf.io/u7qp2/): 

1. The [Information Sheet]() is detailed information on the project. 

2. The [Team Instructions]() is a succinct list of steps for the project. 

3. The [Data Dictionary](https://osf.io/b8pj4/) gives a list of the variables in the dataset. 

## The data

The data for this project is from the Avon Longitudinal study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, also known as Children of the 90s). For more information about the study visit http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/. 

As the ALSPAC data is highly sensitive we cannot open the data to the public without ensuring the data is anonymised and non-identifiable. To achieve this an anonymised (synthetic) dataset will be generated using the R package [SynthPop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/vignettes/synthpop.pdf) (Nowok, Raab & Dibben, 2016) using a non-parameteric method. The missing values will also be generated, it will be your job to deal with them as you see fit. 

The dataset  contains approximatley 15'000 observations of over 80 variables. Along with the sythetic data we will release a description of the annonymisation procedure along with a summary of comparisons between the annonymised and real datasets.
