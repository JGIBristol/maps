## Data dictionary

The data for this project is from the Avon Longitudinal study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, also known as Children of the 90s). For more information about the study visit http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/. 

As the ALSPAC data is highly sensitive we cannot open the data to the public without ensuring the data is anonymised and non-identifiable. To achieve this an anonymised dataset will be generated using the R package SynthPop (Nowok, Raab & Dibben, 2016) on the ALSPAC data, creating the Synthetic Dataset and the Real Dataset. Participants will have access to the Synthetic Dataset but not the Real Dataset. 

The Synthetic and Real Datasets contains approximatley 15'000 observations of over 85 variables. A summary of the variables are shown below. A detailed description of all variables with references (where applicable) will be provided once the data is released.
