<p>The data for this project is from the Avon Longitudinal study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, also known as Children of the 90s). For more information about the study visit <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/">http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/</a>.</p>

<p>As the ALSPAC data is highly sensitive we cannot open the data to the public without ensuring the data is anonymised and non-identifiable. To achieve this an anonymised dataset will be generated using the R package SynthPop (Nowok, Raab &amp; Dibben, 2016) on the ALSPAC data, creating the Synthetic Dataset and the Real Dataset. Participants will have access to the Synthetic Dataset but not the Real Dataset.</p>

<p>The Synthetic and Real Datasets contains 15 observations of over 85 variables. A summary of the variables are shown below. A detailed description of all variables with references (where applicable) will be provided once the data is released.</p>
